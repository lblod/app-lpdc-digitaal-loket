# 24. Development process

Date: 2025-06-18

## Status

Proposed

## Context

## Decision

We will no longer follow trunk-based development. Instead we return to a gitflow based development process.

## Consequences

- Developers will develop their features, fixes, etc. is designated branches, usually split from development.
- A PR should be created Before merging a branch into development. Another developer reviews the PR.
- The creation of releases is usually coordinated with business, and their frequency depends on the changes and needs.
